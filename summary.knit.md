me:    i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual: either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to only wear leather shoes dress shoes.    about you:    you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a good attention span.","2":"currently working as an international agent for a freight forwarding company. import, export, domestic you know the works.  online classes and trying to better myself in my free time. perhaps a hours worth of a good book or a video game on a lazy sunday.","3":"making people laugh.  ranting about a good salting.  finding simplicity in complexity, and complexity in simplicity.","4":"the way i look. i am a six foot half asian, half caucasian mutt. it makes it tough not to notice me, and for me to blend in.","5":"books:  absurdistan, the republic, of mice and men (only book that made me want to cry), catcher in the rye, the prince.    movies:  gladiator, operation valkyrie, the producers, down periscope.    shows:  the borgia, arrested development, game of thrones, monty python    music:  aesop rock, hail mary mallon, george thorogood and the delaware destroyers, felt    food:  i'm down for anything.","6":"food.  water.  cell phone.  shelter.","7":"duality and humorous things","8":"trying to find someone to hang out with. i am down for anything except a club.","9":"i am new to california and looking for someone to wisper my secrets to.","10":"you want to be swept off your feet!  you are tired of the norm.  you want to catch a coffee or a bite.  or if you want to talk philosophy."},{"1":"i am a chef: this is what that means.  1. i am a workaholic.  2. i love to cook regardless of whether i am at work.  3. i love to drink and eat foods that are probably really bad for me.  4. i love being around people that resemble line 1-3.  i love the outdoors and i am an avid skier. if its snowing i will be in tahoe at the very least. i am a very confident and friendly. i'm not interested in acting or being a typical guy. i have no time or patience for rediculous acts of territorial pissing. overall i am a very likable easygoing individual. i am very adventurous and always looking forward to doing new things and hopefully sharing it with the right person.","2":"dedicating everyday to being an unbelievable badass.","3":"being silly. having ridiculous amonts of fun wherever. being a smart ass. ohh and i can cook. ;)","4":"","5":"i am die hard christopher moore fan. i don't really watch a lot of tv unless there is humor involved. i am kind of stuck on 90's alternative music. i am pretty much a fan of everything though... i do need to draw a line at most types of electronica.","6":"delicious porkness in all of its glories.  my big ass doughboy's sinking into 15 new inches.  my overly resilient liver.  a good sharp knife.  my ps3... it plays blurays too. ;)  my over the top energy and my outlook on life... just give me a bag of lemons and see what happens. ;)","7":"","8":"","9":"i am very open and will share just about anything.","10":""},{"1":"i'm not ashamed of much, but writing public text on an online dating site makes me pleasantly uncomfortable. i'll try to be as earnest as possible in the noble endeavor of standing naked before the world.    i've lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on this site), but i'm feeling like meeting some new people that aren't just friends of friends. it's okay if you are a friend of a friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text without moving quickly on to another search result, you are probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid you, but that seems silly.    as far as culture goes, i'm definitely more on the weird side of the spectrum, but i don't exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that while i'd like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and by some definition i certainly am), most people don't see me that way. that's fine with me. most of the people i find myself gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are too.","2":"i make nerdy software for musicians, artists, and experimenters to indulge in their own weirdness, but i like to spend time away from the computer when working on my artwork (which is typically more concerned with group dynamics and communication, than with visual form, objects, or technology). i also record and deejay dance, noise, pop, and experimental music (most of which electronic or at least studio based). besides these relatively ego driven activities, i've been enjoying things like meditation and tai chi to try and gently flirt with ego death.","3":"improvising in different contexts. alternating between being present and decidedly outside of a moment, or trying to hold both at once. rambling intellectual conversations that hold said conversations in contempt while seeking to find something that transcends them. being critical while remaining generous. listening to and using body language--often performed in caricature or large gestures, if not outright interpretive dance. dry, dark, and raunchy humor.","4":"my large jaw and large glasses are the physical things people comment on the most. when sufficiently stimulated, i have an unmistakable cackle of a laugh. after that, it goes in more directions than i care to describe right now. maybe i'll come back to this.","5":"okay this is where the cultural matrix gets so specific, it's like being in the crosshairs.    for what it's worth, i find myself reading more non-fiction than fiction. it's usually some kind of philosophy, art, or science text by silly authors such as ranciere, de certeau, bataille, baudrillard, butler, stein, arendt, nietzche, zizek, etc. i'll often throw in some weird new age or pop-psychology book in the mix as well. as for fiction, i enjoy what little i've read of eco, perec, wallace, bolao, dick, vonnegut, atwood, delilo, etc. when i was young, i was a rabid asimov reader.    directors i find myself drawn to are makavejev, kuchar, jodorowsky, herzog, hara, klein, waters, verhoeven, ackerman, hitchcock, lang, gorin, goddard, miike, ohbayashi, tarkovsky, sokurov, warhol, etc. but i also like a good amount of \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"trashy\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" stuff. too much to name.    i definitely enjoy the character development that happens in long form episodic television over the course of 10-100 episodes, which a 1-2hr movie usually can't compete with. some of my recent tv favorites are: breaking bad, the wire, dexter, true blood, the prisoner, lost, fringe.    a smattered sampling of the vast field of music i like and deejay: art ensemble, sun ra, evan parker, lil wayne, dj funk, mr. fingers, maurizio, rob hood, dan bell, james blake, nonesuch recordings, omar souleyman, ethiopiques, fela kuti, john cage, meredith monk, robert ashley, terry riley, yoko ono, merzbow, tom tom club, jit, juke, bounce, hyphy, snap, crunk, b'more, kuduro, pop, noise, jazz, techno, house, acid, new/no wave, (post)punk, etc.    a few of the famous art/dance/theater folk that might locate my sensibility: andy warhol, bruce nauman, yayoi kusama, louise bourgeois, tino sehgal, george kuchar, michel duchamp, marina abramovic, gelatin, carolee schneeman, gustav metzger, mike kelly, mike smith, andrea fraser, gordon matta-clark, jerzy grotowski, samuel beckett, antonin artaud, tadeusz kantor, anna halperin, merce cunningham, etc. i'm clearly leaving out a younger generation of contemporary artists, many of whom are friends.    local food regulars: sushi zone, chow, ppq, pagolac, lers ros, burma superstar, minako, shalimar, delfina pizza, rosamunde, arinells, suppenkuche, cha-ya, blue plate, golden era, etc.","6":"movement  conversation  creation  contemplation  touch  humor","7":"","8":"viewing. listening. dancing. talking. drinking. performing.","9":"when i was five years old, i was known as \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"the boogerman\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\".","10":"you are bright, open, intense, silly, ironic, critical, caring, generous, looking for an exploration, rather than finding \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"a match\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" of some predetermined qualities.    i'm currently in a fabulous and open relationship, so you should be comfortable with that."},{"1":"i work in a library and go to school. . .","2":"reading things written by old dead people","3":"playing synthesizers and organizing books according to the library of congress classification system","4":"socially awkward but i do my best","5":"bataille, celine, beckett. . .  lynch, jarmusch, r.w. fassbender. . .  twin peaks &amp; fishing w/ john  joy division, throbbing gristle, cabaret voltaire. . .  vegetarian pho and coffee","6":"","7":"cats and german philosophy","8":"","9":"","10":"you feel so inclined."},{"1":"hey how's it going? currently vague on the profile i know, more to come soon. looking to meet new folks outside of my circle of friends. i'm pretty responsive on the reply tip, feel free to drop a line. cheers.","2":"work work work work + play","3":"creating imagery to look at:  http://bagsbrown.blogspot.com/  http://stayruly.blogspot.com/","4":"i smile a lot and my inquisitive nature","5":"music: bands, rappers, musicians  at the moment: thee oh sees.  forever: wu-tang  books: artbooks for days  audiobooks: my collection, thick (thanks audible)  shows: live ones  food: with stellar friends whenever  movies &gt; tv  podcast: radiolab, this american life, the moth, joe rogan, the champs","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":""}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
